To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand microtransactions. The intent is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Austrian economics most of the money will fly right out of a typical gamer’s wallet. There’s also EA’s opportunistic scheming, which is deftly woven into its monetization- its corporate philosophy draws heavily from Hobbesian literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the sense of pride and accomplishment, to realize that they’re not just looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis- they say something deep about challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and OF COURSE attainable via GAMEPLAY.
As a consequence, people who dislike Star Wars™ Battlefront™ 2 truly ARE armchair developers- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in EA’s existential catchphrase “It's In The Game,” which itself is an ironic reference to Norah McClintock’s young adult novel Truth And Lies. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated nerf herders providing candid feedback in earnest as EA’s avarice unfolds itself on their computer screens. What sheep.. how I pity them. 😂
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Star Wars™ Battlefront™ 2 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the Twi'leks’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 60,000 credits of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel armchair developer 😎
